# UX Guide

## Overview
No end-user UI today. This guide covers author-facing touchpoints: CLI/Action UX and markdown documentation style for agents/prompts/skills.

## Design System / Components
- CLI/Actions only; no visual component library. If a UI is added later, choose a system then.

## Styling Approach
- Markdown docs: consistent headings (H1 title, H2 sections), bullet lists for steps, fenced code blocks with language tags.
- Keep prompts/agents concise; favor numbered options for inputs.

## Accessibility
- Write docs with clear, plain language; avoid color-dependent meaning (for future UI).
- For CLI, provide descriptive flag names and `--help` text.

## Responsive Strategy
- Not applicable (no UI). If a web UI is added, adopt mobile-first layouts then.
