# Custom Agents

This document describes the custom agents available in this repository.

## Overview

Custom agents are specialized AI assistants that help with specific tasks in your development workflow. They can be defined using `.agent.md` files and configured to work as specialist teammates or sub-agents.

## Agent Types

### Specialist Teammates
Specialist agents that work alongside you on specific domains or technologies.

### Sub-Agents
Sub-agents that can be invoked to handle specific subtasks within a larger workflow.

## Creating Custom Agents

To create a custom agent, add a `.agent.md` file in the `.github/agents/` directory. The file should contain:

1. Agent name and purpose
2. Specialized instructions
3. Tools and capabilities
4. Example use cases

## Using Custom Agents

Custom agents can be invoked through GitHub Copilot when working on relevant tasks. They will automatically provide specialized assistance based on their configuration.
